Download a hole season of anime 

Currently there is no way to selecting quality, I do plan on adding that later, also for the progress it only shows progress depending on the size of your terminal, I would only recommend downloading 20 episodes at a time but it would probably work with more. also if you want to use a different file server you can change the Userproviders varible in the index file.

## Usage 
```
Either run the start.bat file or 
npm run start
```
This project would be impossible without the scraper from https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli massive thanks to them
